## Project 308
This project processes learner assignment submissions and calculates each learner’s assignment scores and overall weighted average. It simulates how real applications handle and analyze data coming from external sources.

## How It Works
- Loops through assignment and submission data
- Groups submissions by learner
- Calculates percentage scores per assignment
- Applies a 10% penalty for late submissions
- Ignores assignments that are not yet due
- Calculates a weighted average based on points possible
- Uses try/catch to safely handle bad or missing data
- If an error happens, the program logs it and continues without crashing.
